### MIrrigA - Sistema de Manejo de Irrigação para a Agricultura

- This projects uses Leaflet map, which adopts the order **[lat, lon]** for its coordinate system. We also perform calculations using GeoJSON, that uses the order **[lon, lat]**. Just be aware of this when extending the software.

- Always remember to create the folder "node_data" before starting the nodered container
- NodeRed needs the InfluxDB API Token to be able to write data to it
